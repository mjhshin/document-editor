# Cursor Rules

## Code Quality Principles

### No Workarounds
- **Always implement proper fixes**, not workarounds
- Don't mask errors with try-catch blocks that hide the root cause
- Don't skip validation or add "just in case" checks without understanding why
- If a fix seems hacky, it probably is - find the real solution

### Prefer Simple Solutions
- Fix the root cause, not the symptoms
- Keep synchronization logic explicit and understandable
- Avoid complex state machines when simple state updates will do

### When Debugging
1. Understand the root cause before coding
2. Explain the problem clearly before proposing a solution
3. If asked "is this a workaround?", be honest
4. Propose the proper fix, even if it takes longer

### Code Changes
- Clean up temporary fixes once the real solution is implemented
- Remove dead code and unused variables
- Update comments to reflect the actual implementation
